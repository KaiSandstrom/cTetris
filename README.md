# cTetris

##Overview

cTetris is a version of Tetris written in C using minimal graphics. An
as-of-yet-unchosen graphics library will be used to create the game window
and place individual pixels on-screen.

This program was originally a class project for a low-level programming class.
The objective of the project was to write a game for the STM32 Discover Board,
displaying output on the small 127x160 LCD screen, and controlling the game
using tilt controls as well as keyboard input over serial. The earliest commit
with code represents the project source unchanged from when it was submitted.
Note that the board drivers and makefile have been removed, as these were 
provided by the instructors and are not my code to release. This original
code is provided for posterity and documentation, as it will not compile.
